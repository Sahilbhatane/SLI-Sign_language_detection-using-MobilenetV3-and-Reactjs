  "product_overview": "The Sign Language Interpreter application provides real-time sign language recognition using webcam input, translating detected sign phrases into multiple languages, and maintaining a history of detections for user reference. It integrates an AI-powered model backend with a reactive frontend UI to deliver accurate sign detection, translation, and user-friendly interaction.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Enable real-time detection of sign language gestures through webcam capture.",
    "Provide accurate multi-language translation of detected sign phrases to support diverse user needs.",
    "Maintain a comprehensive detection history including phrases, confidence scores, timestamps, and translations.",
    "Offer a responsive, intuitive UI with easy navigation between core functionalities: Home, Detection, and History.",
    "Ensure robust backend connectivity with health status monitoring and error feedback."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Landing Page welcoming users with introduction and feature summaries.",
    "Real-time sign language detection leveraging webcam feed and AI model for phrase recognition.",
    "Start/Stop detection control with live confidence score and top alternative predictions display.",
    "Multi-language translation supporting nine languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and Portuguese.",
    "Detection History interface showing detailed records of detected phrases with timestamps, confidence, and translated text.",
    "Ability to clear detection history with confirmation safeguard for data management.",
    "Backend health check indicator displaying connection status prominently in the app header.",
    "Responsive side navigation bar with iconography for seamless UI section switching.",
    "Smooth animations and UI feedback enhancing user experience via Framer Motion and Tailwind CSS."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User accesses the Home tab to review application overview and feature highlights.",
    "User navigates to the Detect tab, grants webcam permission, and initiates detection using the Start Detection button.",
    "The system captures webcam frames, processes them, and displays the detected sign phrase with confidence metrics and alternative suggestions in real time.",
    "User selects a target language from the language dropdown, triggering translation display of the detected phrase.",
    "User reviews past detections in the History tab, including time, confidence, and translated results.",
    "User may clear the detection history through the provided button with a confirmation step.",
    "Throughout use, the backend health status is checked automatically and displayed, allowing users to see connection reliability."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Real-time detection accuracy meets or exceeds 85% validation accuracy as defined by the underlying AI model.",
    "Detected phrases display with confidence scores and top alternative predictions in under 200 milliseconds of processing time.",
    "Supported translations accurately reflect the detected phrases in any of the nine provided languages.",
    "Detection history records all entries accurately with correct timestamps, phrases, confidence scores, translations, and language metadata.",
    "The backend connection status indicator correctly reflects real-time API health checks every 10 seconds.",
    "UI navigation between Home, Detect, and History tabs is fully responsive and consistent across supported devices and screen sizes.",
    "Start/Stop detection button controls webcam feed reliably without crashes or permission issues.",
    "Clear History functionality prompts for user confirmation and effectively clears all history upon confirmation."
